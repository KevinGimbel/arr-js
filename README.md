# Arr.js
### Initial first version
Arr.js enhances the JavaScript Array Object by providing a set of custom functions. 

Arr.js is mostly a learning-project. I've learned quite a bit about handling arrays and using Prototype (not the framework) while creating it. It's by all means not meant to be used in any kind of production environment. There's a [doc page](http://kevingimbel.com/arr-js/doc/arr.js.html) available.
